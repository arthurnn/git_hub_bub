        #5554\r\n\r\nPreviously the code path for `#count` used some [validation logic](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/54122067acaad39b277a5363c6d11d6804c7bf6b/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/calculations.rb#L389-L394)
        and used to fall back on `#count(:all)`. This prevented the execution of some
        specific count queries.\r\n\r\nThis patch gets rid of the validation logic
        and let''s the database decide if the query is valid or not. One backwards
        incompatible result of this patch is the following:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrelation
        = User.select(\"id, name\")\r\n\r\n# later in the code\r\nrelation.count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis
        count will now blow up because it you can''t count on two columns. The solution
        is to specify the counting column explicitly:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrelation.count(:all)\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10709","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10709/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10709/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10709/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10709","id":14560507,"number":10709,"title":"Wrong

        running model generator it creates a table for the model unless the option
        to skip it is passed.\r\n\r\nwhen looking at the code of model generator it
        looks like model generator is coupled to migration generator code by using
        migration_template method.\r\n\r\nthe code is this:\r\n\r\n      def create_migration_file\r\n        return
        unless options[:migration] && options[:parent].nil?\r\n        attributes.each

        \"db/migrate/create_#{table_name}.rb\"\r\n      end\r\n\r\n I think that the
        migration generator should be the only one creating migration files. I think
        that model generator should invoke migration generator instead of just creating
        the migration file by using a method (#migration_template) that belongs to
        the module Rails::Generators:Migration (included in ActiveRecord::Generators::Base
        class)\r\n\r\nsomething like this would make more sense:\r\n\r\nhook_for :migration
        do |instance, generator|\r\n  # options control\r\n  invoke generator, [\"create_#{instance.name.underscore.pluralize\"]\r\nend\r\n\r\nhowever
        it is not working because the ARGV is empty  (somehow in between args are
        being cleared) and the options are not being piped somehow. \r\n\r\ninvoke
        method prototype is: invoke(namespace, args=ARGV, config={})\r\n\r\nDoes this
        make sense or there is a reason that things are like this because of Thor?

        noticed an issue while using the MailView gem, which someone discovered a
        few months ago: https://github.com/37signals/mail_view/issues/37\r\n\r\nI
        traced the issue down to this commit: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2ed325a3e90fc17c2d52a26bd1799b5f4e4bdf88\r\n\r\nThe
        issue manifests as an exception \"A copy of <name> has been removed from the
        module tree but is still active!\" ...which is coming from here: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb#L444-L446\r\n\r\nThe
        MailView gem asks you to put a mailer in `app/mailers` like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass
        MessagePreview < MailView\r\n  def example\r\n    ExampleMailer.example\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf
        you change any model or controller in your application, you are forced to
        `touch tmp/restart.txt` to avoid raising the exception. I''m able to work
        around the issue by using the double-colon thingamajig to ensure we''re at
        the top namespace:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MessagePreview < MailView\r\n  def
        example\r\n    ::ExampleMailer.example\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n...but
        notice it''s done on the mailer. I did some debugging and noticed something
        strange in `load_missing_constant` like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nload_missing_constant(from_mod,
        const_name)\r\nfrom_mod = MessagePreview\r\nconst_name = ExampleMailer\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo,
        I believe `Dependencies` is (incorrectly?) assuming that `ExampleMailer` is
        defined in `MessagePreview` when it is just a regular mailer defined like
        so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass ExampleMailer < ApplicationMailer\r\n  def example\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which,
        I believe was changed by this commit: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2ed325a3e90fc17c2d52a26bd1799b5f4e4bdf88\r\n\r\nI''m
        not sure if this is a bug with Rails or with MailView, to be honest. I haven''t
        looked at the ActiveSupport::Dependencies code until now. Something seems
        fishy, though, so I thought I should open an issue here to get some more :eyes:
        on it. \r\n\r\n/cc @fxn \r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10682","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10682/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10682/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10682","id":14491022,"number":10682,"title":"Adds

        have a few concerns about the way the rails generator creates a controller,

        not previously defined, rails will output an ''uninitialized constant'' error.\r\n2.
        The generator does not follow the ruby idiom for nesting modules.\r\n3. Using

        moving the existing handlers to this format, we were also able to\r\nnicely

        make it fairly simple to add make it possible to define special handling for
